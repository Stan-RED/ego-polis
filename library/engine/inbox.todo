* It's very strange that there is no verb "to engine". According to the
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-er, forming nouns from verbs is the most
  typical case. And only third place is from nouns with "occupation" meaning.
  Software engineering sounds stupid then. They should be "softwarers".
  Etymology drives a perfect sense of "to engine" verb, to put a "genius"
  inside some device.
