This project is an experimental laboratory where we try to look at the software
design process and application code from more phylosophical, fundamental point
of view.

## Philosophy

### Codesity

Documentation, e2e-testing, deployment and any other stage of the software
development lifecycle should has the code as the SSOT (single point of truth)
and be powered by code as much as possible.

### Atomicity

Looking for fundamental solutions we should be based on the most atomic concepts
those give the most flexibility. This principle is strongly involved in software
design principles like well-known SoC (Separation of concerns), SRP (Single
responsibility principle), decoupling and others.
